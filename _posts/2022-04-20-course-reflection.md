## Defining the Digital Humanities
Like many others, I began the semester with no understanding of the Digital Humanities (DH). When I signed up for the course, I simply believed it would teach me how to be an effective writer online. I certainly was not wrong, but my assumption did not acknowledge the use of the phrase "Digital Humanities". Though, after a brief introduction to DH and a project classification activity, I settled on the definition below.

> Digital Humanities is the use of technology to analyze information in order to answer a question or educate others.

After a semester of studying DH, I have determined that my original definition was lacking a few key ideas. Upon revisiting this past exercise, I came up with the following revised definition.

> Digital Humanities is the use of technology to explore information in new ways. Through the construction of interactive experiences, digital humanists are able to educate others and conduct research to answer important questions.

My experience has taught me that there is an emphasis on interactivity and analyzing information in different non-traditional ways in the field of DH.
