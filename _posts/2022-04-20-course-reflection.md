## Defining the Digital Humanities
Like many others, I began the semester with no understanding of the Digital Humanities (DH). When I signed up for the course, I simply believed it would teach me how to be an effective writer online. I certainly was not wrong, but my assumption did not acknowledge what the phrase "Digital Humanities" actually meant. After a brief introduction to DH and a project classification activity, I settled on the definition below.

> Digital Humanities is the use of technology to analyze information in order to answer a question or educate others.

Over the course of the semester, I have found that my original definition was mostly correct. Though, I noticed it lacks a few key characteristics of DH. Upon rethinking what DH encompasses, I came up with the following revised definition.

> Digital Humanities is the use of technology to explore information in new ways. Through the construction of interactive experiences, digital humanists are able to educate others and conduct research to answer important questions.

My experience has taught me that the DH field is interactive, collaborative, and often focused on visualizing information in non-traditional ways. Throughout the course, I encountered several non-DH projects that met my original criteria, but failed to execute on the last few pillars of DH.

## Readings
The assigned readings for this course were always relevant and applicable to what we were doing in class. They often highlighted the intricacies of DH and challenged me to consider my previous experiences. I found the reading, ["Racism in the Machine: Visualization Ethics in Digital Humanities Projects"](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/4/000408/000408.html) to be particularly interesting. As a computer science major, I think almost everyone visualizes data at some point in their career, so it is important to understand how to ethically do so. This reading also allowed me to pull from my knowledge of computer ethics and how they handle

Of all the readings, I tended to enjoy the readings that were more broadly applicable such as the 

## Assignments & Class Activities
I liked carrying class discussions over Twitter because relieved the pressure in class and it allowed us to learn a platform that will be useful after this class. I felt Twitter also allowed us to engage in different ways that aren’t available with traditional discussion platforms such as retweeting and liking. The notorious character limit really helped me learn how to write in a digital space. Tweeting also helped me get my ideas down once I had read the material which kept me from forgetting my main takeaways. Though I really enjoyed the DH review blog. It is super easy to look at a project and miss critical issues such as the lack of alt text, or the when certain features fall apart like the navigation app in my Navigating the Green Book project. This review really informed my definition of DH and helped me generate ideas for my grant proposal. My grant proposal was one of the things I enjoyed most about the course though, it was one of the things I was also most concerned about at the beginning of the semester. The professor I was doing research with had mentioned the Independent Research Grant, but I had no idea how to actually write one, much less how to tailor it to a diverse audience and make it concise and understandable. While I do believe my final draft of the grant could’ve been better, the experience revising and getting feedback from others is something I will most certainly remember as I work on an actual independent research grant proposal. It was especially nice to have the formal introduction to the grant from Dr. Solomon as that was the first time I had ever seen him, and his advice was incredibly valuable. Hearing about what makes a successful proposal and getting the chance to try, and sometimes fail, ultimately eased my tensions about the proposal. I also thought the modification of the requirements to allow us to submit a resume was extremely thoughtful and definitely helpful as I had never written a resume prior to this course and I likely would’ve procrastinated writing one if it wasn’t for it being a part of our requirements. I think allowing us to choose between a resume and a CV was the right decision even though CV’s are more commonly used when applying for grants. I think that though writing for the DH is supposed to place emphasis on brevity it really takes skill to create a concise blog that conveys your ideas, even though it might be considered easier in terms of word count. I struggled with this at times, but I also found it valuable because today most people generally don’t read a lot of text at one time, especially online. Knowing how to craft a [blog syn] in a short and simple way is paramount now.
