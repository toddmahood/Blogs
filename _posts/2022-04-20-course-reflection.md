## Defining the Digital Humanities
Like many others, I began the semester with no understanding of the Digital Humanities (DH). When I signed up for the course, I simply believed it would teach me how to be an effective writer online. I was certainly not wrong, but my assumption did not acknowledge the use of the phrase "Digital Humanities". Though, after a brief introduction to DH and a project classification activity, I settled on the definition below:

> Digital humanities is the use of technology to analyze information in order to answer a question or educate others.


> Digital Humanities is the use of technology to explore topics in new ways. Through the construction of new interactive experiences, digital humanists can educate others and conduct research to answer important questions.
