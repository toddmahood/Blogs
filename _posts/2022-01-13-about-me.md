## Background
I grew up in Lexington, VA and graduated from Rockbridge County High School. I have two younger sisters that are about to graduate from there as well! I My passion for computers stems from the experiences they create. Prior to COVID-19, I was a camp counselor at our annual local elementary STEAM camp. Seeing the campers' reactions to various demos and experiments throughout camp inspired me to pursue a degree in computer science. While I am primarily taking this class for my writing intensive requirement, I am looking forward to incorporating the skills I learn into my own projects. I believe these skills will be especially useful for writing documentation for my code.
