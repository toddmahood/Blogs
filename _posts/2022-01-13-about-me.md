## <u>Biography<u>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Todd Mahood, but you might also know me as Alex (_either name works_). I am a student, software developer, researcher, and volunteer. Currently, I am a sophomore at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, VA. I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in data science and information science. My pronouns are he/him/his.

## Background
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up in Lexington, VA and graduated from Rockbridge County High School. I have two younger sisters that are about to graduate from there as well! My passion for computers stems from the experiences they create. Prior to COVID-19, I was a camp counselor at our annual local elementary STEAM camp. Seeing the campers' reactions to various demos and experiments throughout camp inspired me to pursue a degree in computer science. 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am primarily taking Writing for the Digital Humanities to satisfy the writing intensive requirement, I am looking forward to using the skills I learn to create the same memorable experiences. I also believe this class will help improve my writing and communication skills.

## Community Involvement
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In high school, I was editor in chief of _[The Maverick](https://www.blurb.com/books/8737953-the-maverick-volume-two)_, a student-run literary and arts magazine. This involved gathering submissions from the community, designing the magazine layout, and placing photos using Adobe InDesign. 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also a presenter at Lexington's Science Festival & Maker Faire. As a presenter, I was responsible for showcasing new developments in our elementary STEAM curriculum. STEAM is important to me because it allows me to utilize everything I know and apply it to real life situations. Additionally, being a presenter allowed me to practice my leadership skills and share my knowledge with others. I learned how to communicate important concepts through projects that were fun, engaging, and informative. In 2019, I built mini flashlights with students to demonstrate the concept of circuits.

## Campus Involvement
Here is a list of things I am involved with now at Christopher Newport University:
- Treasurer of the [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) club](https://thecompass.cnu.edu/organization/acm) on campus.
- Student research using machine learning to determine character traits based on interview transcripts with Dr. Samuel Henry.
- Member of the Linux User Group.

## Looking Forward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I graduate, I am hoping to get a job as a software engineer. I am particularly interested in web applications and natural language processing. I would like to eventually get a masters degree in computer science as well.
