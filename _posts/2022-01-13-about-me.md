My name is Todd Mahood, but you might also know me as Alex _(either name works)_. I am a student, software developer, researcher, and volunteer. Currently, I am a sophomore at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, VA. I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in data science and information science. My pronouns are he/him/his.

## Background
I grew up in Lexington, VA and graduated from Rockbridge County High School. I have two younger sisters that are about to graduate from there as well! My passion for computers stems from the experiences they create. Prior to COVID-19, I was a camp counselor at our annual local elementary STEAM camp. Seeing the campers' reactions to various demos and experiments throughout camp inspired me to pursue a degree in computer science. While I am primarily taking this Digital Humanities course to satisfy the writing intensive requirement, I am looking forward to using the skills I learn to create the same memorable experiences. I also believe this class will help improve my writing and communication skills.

## Community Involvement
In high school, I was editor in chief of _[The Maverick](https://www.blurb.com/books/8737953-the-maverick-volume-two)_, a student-run digital arts magazine for our high school. In addition to being a STEAM camp counselor, I was also a presenter at Lexington's Science Festival & Maker Faire. As a presenter, I was responsible for showcasing new developments in our elementary STEAM curriculum. STEAM is important to me because it allows me to utilize everything I know and apply it to real life situations. Additionally, being a presenter allowed me to practice my leadership skills and share my knowledge with others. I learned how to communicate important concepts through projects that were fun, engaging, and informative. In 2019, I built mini flashlights with students to demonstrate the concept of circuits.

## Campus Involvement
Here is a list of things I am currently involved with at CNU:
- Treasurer of the [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)](https://thecompass.cnu.edu/organization/acm) on campus.
- Student research using machine learning to determine character traits based on interview transcripts with Dr. Henry 
- Member of the Linux User Group

## Looking Forward
After I graduate, I am hoping to get a job as a software engineer. Although, I would like to eventually get my masters degree as well.
