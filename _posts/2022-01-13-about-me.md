My name is Todd Mahood, but you might also know me as Alex _(either name works)_. I am a student, software developer, researcher, and volunteer. Currently, I am a sophomore at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, VA. I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in data science and information science. My pronouns are he/him/his.

## Background
I grew up in Lexington, VA and graduated from Rockbridge County High School. I have two younger sisters that are about to graduate from there as well! My passion for computers stems from the experiences they create. Prior to COVID-19, I was a camp counselor at our annual local elementary STEAM camp. Seeing the campers' reactions to various demos and experiments throughout camp inspired me to pursue a degree in computer science. While I am primarily taking this class for my writing intensive requirement, I am looking forward to learning more about how to write in digital spaces.
