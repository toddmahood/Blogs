## Summary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Navigating the Green Book_ (NGB) is a digital humanities project that aids in the visualization of racial segregation, descrimination, and eventually the civil rights movement. The _Green Book_ series was created by Victor Green in a bid to protect black Americans as they traveled across the United States. It acted as a directory of locations where black men were safe and welcome to travel. NGB utilizes Mapbox, Scribe, Leaflet, and Open Street Map to analyze and plot the data contained in the _Green Books_. The result is an explorable map with routing functionality that allows the user to see geographically where black travelers could go and allows the user to plan a trip accordingly. By offering a new lens through which racial inequity can be viewed, Foo hopes users will critically examine their own lives and how they would be different if they were of another race.

## Map Exploration 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon first viewing the map, I noticed the lack of a legend and key. While the colors and icons present in the cluster map are fairly self explanatory, a key and legend would certainly enhance the usability of the map. I do, however, appreciate the numerical data included within the clusters. I think it helps the user to visualize where black Americans were more likely to travel. Admittedly, I was distracted by the individual location icons when the map was zoomed out. Instead I would reserve the rendering of icons for when the user begins to zoom in on a specific location. After further inspection, it also appears the icons (hotel, tavern, restaurant) lack alt text. This is crucial for those with visual impairments, so it is important that this is added in the future.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More curiously, are the outlines that enwrap the clusters. Some of these outlines overlap other outlines and don’t appear to be symmetrical in any way. As a user, this genuinely confused me. I don’t understand the need for an outline around the clusters, especially if that outline interferes with other clusters. I understand this could be a limitation of the map’s implementation, although I would most certainly advise that it be removed.
