## Summary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Navigating the Green Book_ (NGB) is a digital humanities project that aids in the visualization of racial segregation, descrimination, and eventually the civil rights movement. The _Green Book_ series was created by Victor Green in a bid to protect black Americans as they traveled across the United States. It acted as a directory of locations where black men were safe and welcome to travel. NGB utilizes Mapbox, Scribe, Leaflet, and Open Street Map to analyze and plot the data contained in the _Green Books_. The result is an explorable map with routing functionality that allows the user to see geographically where black travelers could go and allows the user to plan a trip accordingly. By offering a new lens through which racial inequity can be viewed, Foo hopes users will critically examine their own lives and how they would be different if they were of another race.
