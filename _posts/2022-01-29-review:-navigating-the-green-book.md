## Summary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Navigating the Green Book_ (NGB) is a digital humanities project that aids in the visualization of racial segregation, descrimination, and eventually the civil rights movement. The _Green Book_ series was created by Victor Green in a bid to protect black Americans as they traveled across the United States. It acted as a directory of locations where black men were safe and welcome to travel. NGB utilizes Mapbox, Scribe, Leaflet, and Open Street Map to analyze and plot the data contained in the _Green Books_. The result is an explorable map with routing functionality that allows the user to see geographically where black travelers could go and allows the user to plan a trip accordingly. By offering a new lens through which racial inequity can be viewed, Foo hopes users will critically examine their own lives and how they would be different if they were of another race.

## Map Exploration

The numerical data included within the clusters is a nice visual representation of where black Americans were more likely to travel. However, both the cluster view and heatmap view can be confusing and counterintuitive without the inclusion of a legend. Furthermore, the rendering of individual location icons (hotel, tavern, restaurant) while the map is zoomed out distracts me as a user. I would recommend th More curiously, are the outlines that enwrap the clusters. Some of these outlines overlap other outlines and don’t appear to be symmetrical in any way. As a user, this genuinely confused me. I don’t understand the need for an outline around the clusters, especially if that outline interferes with other clusters. I understand this could be a limitation of the map’s implementation, although I would most certainly advise that it be removed.
