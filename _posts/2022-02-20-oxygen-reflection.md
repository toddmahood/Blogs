## Overview
For this assignment, I was tasked with encoding the fifth and sixth paragraphs of "Dracula’s Guest" using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards. "Dracula’s Guest" is a short story that was written by Bram Stoker and released posthumously by his wife. **Finish description, describe XML, give brief synopsis of what I learned**

## Google Docs Exercise
To begin the encoding process, I used Google Docs to highlight several important features of my text. For our purposes, Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used to denote visible characteristics of the text. This is important because we want the text to be properly formatted when it is displayed. During the exercise, I was looking for paragraphs, quotes, page breaks, em-dashes, titles, inscriptions, and addresses. In my specific section, I noted the use of many quotes. **elaborate on what this means in the context of Dracula’s Guest**

Ultimately, I found that this activity made the actual coding process much easier and quicker than it would’ve been had I not determined what needed to be tagged first.

## Encoding the Text
I have had prior experience coding in Python and Java, so I wasn’t very intimidated by the thought of learning a new language. However, I had never looked at markup language syntax before and the concept of wrapping text was new to me. Fortunately, I caught on pretty quickly and was able to finish my portion of the story without too many issues. I did face some challenges as I went through the process, though.

One of the challenges I faced was determining whether or not the code I created did what it was supposed to do. The editor does have a box in the upper right corner of the window to show if the document is valid. Although, as I know from my previous experience with Java and Python, just because your code is syntactically correct doesn’t mean it is without bugs or that it even accomplishes the goal for which it was created. Oxygen’s solution to this problem is their “Author” view, however I lacked the knowledge of how several tags were supposed to appear in their rendered form which made this feature less useful for me. 

I also had to adjust to the autocomplete functionality of Oxygen editor. When I typed out tags, Oxygen would automatically add the closing tag. This caused me to make a few mistakes, but it was nothing that quick proofreading couldn’t fix.
